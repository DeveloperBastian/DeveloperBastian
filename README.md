**Unreal Lyra development with BluePrints - a learning journey**

I started learning Unreal and Lyra in summer 2022 and plan to develop a small walking/RPG/Survival game step by step while documenting every milestone

# Video channel
Visit my Youtube channel at [https://www.youtube.com/@bastiandev/videos](https://www.youtube.com/@bastiandev/videos) to see the chronology of my attempts along that way.
I split that journey into an [english](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=frpAzIuGLDU&list=PLK0EcCQf_rrZUfro2vlwFLQ1Y8itOVSgd) and a [german](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rdFjPHC-rlg&list=PLK0EcCQf_rrbllC32wvGTJxINbO4yXb0U) channel.

# Infographic
I like to see components working togeher to understand how to use them best. As Lyra is a bit thinly documented, I started to create an [Infographic](https://github.com/DeveloperBastian/Unreal-Lyra-Concepts) to better visualize these concepts and connect them to my videos.

I hops this content can helkp you a bit on your game creation journey, have fun!
